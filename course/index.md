# Data Engineering for Machine Learning

*Data Engineering for Machine Learning* is a novel course at the intersection of Systems, Big Data and Machine Learning. The course focuses on **machine learning systems in the real-world**, as well as on **data-related problems** that typically occur in end-to-end machine learning deployments. The lectures cover systems deployed in practice at companies like Google, Twitter & Amazon, and research from a variety of conferences such as [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/) (ML), [VLDB](hhttps://vldb.org/2019/) / [SIGMOD](https://http://sigmod2019.org/) (data management) and [OSDI](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi18) (systems). Students will learn about **abstractions and concepts of ML-related systems** on the on hand, and gain **practical experiences in use cases such as data and model validation, experiment databases, and data cleaning** on the other hand.

This course will be taught by [Sebastian Schelter](https://ssc.io), an MSDSE Fellow at CDS. Sebastian has already gained a lot of practical experience in real-world ML systems, as an intern with the [recommender systems team at Twitter](https://ssc.io/pdf/factorbird.pdf), and as a Senior Applied Scientist at [Amazon Core AI Berlin](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1781-schelter.pdf), where he spent three years before joining NYU. He is a committer and PMC member in several systems-related projects of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org). Additionally, he mentors the deep learning-related project [Apache TVM](https://tvm.ai) for the Apache Incubator, and is the creator and chair of the workshop series on ['Data Management for End-to-End Machine Learning'](http://deem-workshop.org) at ACM SIGMOD.
